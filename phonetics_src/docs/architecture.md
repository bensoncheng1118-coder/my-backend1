# Architecture: the acoustic model

How CHIMERA makes sound. This was the original design (moved here from `DESIGN.md`); the
engine's real-time contract and the browser boundary are in [rust-engine.md](rust-engine.md),
and the look in [ui-redesign.md](ui-redesign.md).

The owner's brief: "Create the ultimate vocal synthesizer. Web app for now. Be extremely
ambitious. Sophisticated throat, lips, tongue modeling. Different animals: human, bird, reptile,
etc. Tonal and percussive (beatboxing). Beautiful visuals/diagrams, dynamic animations based on
params."

**Not built (yet):** the design's wider bestiary (only songbird, seal, alligator and elephant
exist), the two-mass vocal folds, an IPA chart mode, the app-side EQ/reverb/limiter chain and
in-app WAV export (the CLI renders WAVs; the app has a close-mic chain in WebAudio). Treat the
code as the truth where this file disagrees.

Control rate: every 64–128 output samples, with per-sample linear interpolation of areas.

## 1. Airway acoustics — branched staggered-grid FDTD transmission line

Chosen over Kelly-Lochbaum because it handles, in one framework: variable section
lengths (larynx height, lip protrusion, creature size), DC aerodynamics (pressure
build-up behind closures, bursts), nonlinear kinetic losses at constrictions, yielding
walls, moving-wall volume sources (needed for clicks, ejectives, implosives), arbitrary
branching (nasal tract, sinuses, piriform fossae, two bronchi, vocal sacs, OEC).

* Units CGS. ρ = 1.14e-3 g/cm³, c = 35 000 cm/s, μ = 1.86e-4 P.
* Generic graph: pressure nodes (volume V = AΔ) and flow branches between nodes.
  Branch inertance L = ρ(Δa/2Aa + Δb/2Ab) (series half-sections, so a tiny node is
  bracketed by large inertances → stable at CFL ≤ 1 regardless of area ratio).
* Leapfrog: branches update U(n+½) from p(n); nodes update p(n+1) from U(n+½).
  Branch update is implicit in U for losses: viscous R, plus Borda–Carnot expansion
  loss a·|U|U with a = ρk/2·(1/As − 1/Al)² chosen by flow direction; solved as an
  exact quadratic per sample (avoids the period-2 instability of lagged |U|).
* Continuity: (V/ρc²) dp/dt = ΣU_in − ΣU_out − U_wall − dV/dt (moving walls).
* Walls: per-node mass–spring–damper (m≈1.5 g/cm², r≈1600, k≈3e5 CGS, ×perimeter·Δ).
  Wall flow also radiates weakly (voice bar during voiced closures).
* Radiation: Flanagan parallel R–L load at lips/nostrils/beak; output = d/dt of radiated
  volume velocity (sum of mouth, nostrils, skin).
* Turbulence: per branch Reynolds number Re = |U|·d_h/(A·ν); dipole pressure source
  g·(Re² − Re_c²)·noise injected ~1 cm downstream of the constriction exit (flow-direction
  aware), plus an obstacle source at the lower incisors when a jet reaches them (sibilants).
  Aspiration is the same mechanism at the glottis.
* Closure: branch area < ε ⇒ U = 0 (no leakage); node volumes floored for compliance.
* Internal rate 96 kHz (adult human), 192 kHz (small birds/cats), 48 kHz allowed for
  huge tracts; N chosen per anatomy so Δ ≥ c·T/0.95. Polyphase half-band decimation to
  the output rate.
* Cross-check: a frequency-domain chain-matrix model with the same loss terms computes
  H(f) for analysis, UI formant display, and as a test oracle for the FDTD.

## 2. Sources

* **Parametric glottis (default, exact pitch)**: glottal *area* pulse (opening/closing
  phases, open quotient, skew, max area, rest/abduction area, posterior chink) drives the
  interactive glottal branch, so flow shape, skewing, F1 ripple and devoicing under
  oral closure all emerge from the tract. Perturbations: jitter, shimmer, vibrato with
  drift, 1/f flutter, diplophonia/period doubling, vocal fry (low f0, short OQ, double
  pulses), falsetto (sinusoidal, incomplete closure).
* **Two-mass vocal folds (advanced)**: Ishizaka–Flanagan with collision; self-oscillating;
  pitch tracked by a feedback controller on the tension factor Q.
* **Ventricular folds**: second valve above the glottis, entrains at f0/2 for growl /
  kargyraa; static narrowing for harshness. **Epilarynx** narrowing for twang/ring.
* **Syrinx (birds)**: two independent labial oscillators (Gardner–Mindlin normal form
  ẋ=y, ẏ=−αγ²−βγ²x−γ²x³−γx²y+γ²x²−γxy). γ is a pure time scale, so pitch is exact:
  γ = 2π f0 / F(α,β) with F tabulated offline; α (air-sac pressure) and β (tension)
  shape the waveform (pure tone → pulses → period doubling/chaos). Each labium gates its
  own bronchus; bronchi merge into the trachea → OEC (Helmholtz, volume tracks f0 for
  pure tones) → beak (gape-dependent radiation).
* **Flow-induced valves**: one mass–spring valve model driven by constriction pressure
  (Bernoulli suction / upstream push) for lip trill, tongue-tip trill, uvular trill,
  lip buzz (beatbox bass, elephant trumpet as a lip-reed at the trunk base). Optional
  phase-locked drive if self-oscillation is not robust.
* **Airstream mechanisms**: lung pressure may be negative (ingressive); glottal closure +
  larynx raising/lowering (ejectives/implosives via dV/dt); velaric closure + tongue
  dorsum lowering (clicks). All physical through the FDTD — no special-cased samples.

## 3. Anatomy & articulation (human first, others as parametric variants)

* 2D midsagittal geometry (cm, head frame): fixed outer wall (posterior pharynx, velum,
  hard palate, alveolar ridge, upper incisors, upper lip) and moving inner wall
  (epiglottis/larynx, tongue root, tongue body circle, blade, tip, lower incisors,
  lower lip, jaw).
* Articulators (state, all absolute head-frame so consonant constrictions are exact):
  jaw, tongue body centre (x,y), tongue tip (x,y), tip curl (retroflex), central groove,
  lateral channel, tongue root, lip aperture (negative = compression), lip protrusion,
  lip width/rounding, labiodental, velum port area, larynx height, epilarynx, glottal
  abduction / closure, lung pressure, f0, effort, ventricular, trill drives, dorsum
  lowering (clicks).
* Area function: semipolar grid (horizontal lines in pharynx, radial in oral cavity,
  vertical at lips) intersected with inner/outer contours → midsagittal distance d →
  A = α·d^β per region; tongue grooving/laterals modify A; lengths from midpoint chain.
  Resampled to N uniform sections of current length L(t).
* Calibration: optimise vowel targets against reference formants (Hillenbrand 1995 male
  means, plus cardinal vowels for non-English) with the chain-matrix model. Female/child
  via anatomical scaling (shorter pharynx proportion), not formant warping.
* The body is continuous (`BodyMix`: a female axis and a child axis): anatomy, calibrated
  phoneme targets and default pitch blend the three calibrated bodies by weight. A body
  change rebuilds the airway (its node counts follow the tract length).
* Other mammals/reptiles: same topology, species parameters (snout length, palate
  shape, larynx position/descent, nasal length, lip shape, trunk = long nasal tube,
  vocal sac = Helmholtz side branch). Birds: separate topology (syrinx/trachea/OEC/beak,
  tongue for parrots).

## 4. Control: gestures (Articulatory Phonology–style)

* Phoneme = set of gestures, each controlling a subset of articulators with targets,
  stiffness, blending strength and timing relative to the segment.
* Gestural score: vowel gestures span vowel to vowel (tongue body keeps moving through
  consonants — Öhman coarticulation); consonant gestures overlay their articulators
  with higher strength; uncontrolled articulators relax to neutral.
* Articulator dynamics: critically damped 2nd-order per articulator, physiological
  speeds (lips/tip fast, tongue body/jaw slower, velum/larynx slow).
* Consonant closures use overshoot targets clamped by the geometry (contact), so
  closures are robust; fricatives specify exact gap.
* Text: CMUdict (lazy-loaded, compact) + rule fallback → ARPAbet → IPA; stress;
  syllabification; Klatt-style durations; intonation (declination, H* on stressed
  syllables, final fall / question rise). Singing: notes+lyrics → syllable alignment.

## 5. FX / output

DC blocker → mic model (distance/proximity) → EQ → compressor → saturation → reverb →
limiter. WAV export via the same engine in a Worker (unlimited voices, faster than RT).

## Known risks

* Fricative and burst realism depends on noise-source calibration (gain, placement, spectrum).
* Geometry → area calibration decides vowel quality.
* Self-oscillating valves (trills) can be finicky; keep parametric fallbacks.

## References and credits

The engine isn't a port of another synthesizer. It was written for this project, first in
TypeScript and then ported to Rust, by the owner working with AI coding agents (the commit
history shows both). It contains no other synthesizer's code: its only dependencies are the
`libm` crate (a Rust port of musl's math library) and `serde`. The design notes above name
models more often than papers. This section lists only what the code, its comments, the docs
and the commit history actually cite, and says where they cite nothing.

### What the voice builds on

- **Airway walls** (`physics.rs`): the soft-tissue mass, resistance and stiffness per unit area
  come from Ishizaka, French & Flanagan (1975). The trachea's stiffer values aren't attributed.
- **Radiation** at the lips, nostrils and beak (`airway/network.rs`): Flanagan's parallel R–L
  load. The code names Flanagan but no publication.
- **Vowel targets** (`phonetics/vowel_data.rs`, `chimera calibrate`): the English vowels are
  calibrated to the men's, women's and children's means of Hillenbrand, Getty, Clark & Wheeler
  (1995). The other vowels use "typical literature values" whose source isn't recorded.
- **Segment durations** (`phonetics/durations.rs`): Klatt's (1979) duration rules as given for
  MITalk in Allen, Hunnicutt & Klatt (1987), ch. 9.
- **Gestures** (`control/score.rs`, `control/articulators.rs`, `phonetics/planner.rs`): the code
  calls its gestural score "Articulatory Phonology style", its articulator dynamics
  "Task-Dynamics style", and its vowel-to-vowel coarticulation Öhman's. These are the frameworks
  of Browman & Goldstein, Saltzman & Munhall, and Öhman. CHIMERA takes their ideas, not a
  formulation from any one paper.
- **Articulator speeds** (`control/articulators.rs`): checked against VocalTractLab's
  (P. Birkholz) fitted time constants, mostly 5–40 ms. Only as a range to check against: no
  VocalTractLab code or data is used.
- **Songbird syrinx** (`sources/syrinx.rs`): the labial oscillator is what the code calls the
  Gardner–Mindlin normal form. The repo doesn't record which paper it came from.
- **Voice-source defaults**, from the tuning log ([hill-climb/log.md](hill-climb/log.md)): the
  posterior glottal chink that stays open through closure follows Södersten & Lindestad (1990)
  (experiment 3); the 6 Hz default vibrato rate follows Prame (1994) (experiment 9). The log
  cites more papers for experiments that were reverted; those changes aren't in the engine.
- **Pronunciation**: the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (bundled, BSD licence).

### Standard methods

Textbook techniques with no single source behind them: the staggered-grid (leapfrog) FDTD
transmission line, Borda–Carnot expansion loss, Reynolds-number turbulence noise, Crank–Nicolson
coupling of the radiation load, the frequency-domain chain-matrix analysis, Kaiser-windowed sinc
decimation, LPC (autocorrelation with Levinson–Durbin, roots by Durand–Kerner), the radix-2 FFT,
Nelder–Mead, Catmull–Rom splines, maximal-onset syllabification, and the van der Pol and
Rayleigh–Plesset oscillators behind some creature sounds.

### Not attributed

- **The airway model as a whole.** Section 1 explains why it is an FDTD network rather than
  Kelly–Lochbaum, but no paper or earlier implementation is cited for it.
- **The area function** (`anatomy/human.rs`): the semipolar grid and the A = α·d^β law have
  the same form as the usual sagittal-distance-to-area conversions in the literature, but none
  is cited. Where the coefficients (`AreaLaw`) came from isn't recorded, except the 1.6 for the
  space ahead of the tongue tip, which came from hill-climb experiment 12.
- **The glottal area pulse** (`sources/glottis.rs`): parametric, with no published pulse model
  cited.
- **The creatures' anatomy** (seal, alligator, elephant, songbird tract): no source recorded.
- **Aalto University's speech modelling group.** Nothing in the code, docs or history mentions
  the group or its work, so we can't say CHIMERA builds on it. Physical vocal-tract models share
  a lot of ground, so the resemblance may not point to a borrowing.

The two-mass (Ishizaka–Flanagan) folds named in section 2 were designed but never built, so they
aren't a source of the current sound.

### Data and tools that measure the voice

These judge the voice and aren't part of its sound: the Children's Song Dataset (Choi, Kim,
Park, Yong & Nam, ISMIR 2020; [csd-comparison.md](csd-comparison.md)); the TSP speech database
(P. Kabal, McGill University, 2018) aligned with the Montreal Forced Aligner (McAuliffe et al.,
Interspeech 2017; [speech-comparison.md](speech-comparison.md)); Whisper (`small.en` through
faster-whisper) on Harvard sentences (IEEE 1969); YIN pitch (de Cheveigné & Kawahara 2002);
and in `chimera diagnose`, the nasality threshold of Bunton & Story (2011), the
long-term average speech spectrum of Byrne et al. (1994) and Klatt's default formant
bandwidths.
